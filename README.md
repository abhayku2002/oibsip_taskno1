#IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

The Iris dataset is a classic and well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It comprises information about three different species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. This dataset is often employed for various tasks such as classification, pattern recognition, and data visualization.
The dataset contains the following attributes for each flower specimen:
1.sepal length in centimeters
2.sepal width in centimeters
3.petal length in centimeters
4.petal width in centimeters
These attributes serve as features that help discriminate between the three Iris species. The Iris dataset is often used as a fundamental example for introducing concepts such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and classification algorithms in machine learning courses and tutorials.
Based on these four features, the goal is often to classify each flower into one of the three species. The dataset is balanced, meaning there is an equal number of samples for each species.
